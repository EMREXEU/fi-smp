            Importing results from your studies abroad is an quick and easy process in four steps. Each step is briefly described below.

            1. First you select the country where you studied abroad.

            2. Second you use the credentials from one of the universities where you studied to log into the system where your results are stored.
            -- You will be able to import results from all the universities you studied at.

            3. Third you select the results you want to import as results to your major university.

            4. The fourth and last step is to review your selections and confirm that they are correct.

            Now you are all done and your results from studying abroad can be used to apply for courses at your major university.
